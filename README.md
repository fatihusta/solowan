#SoloWAN Project

OpenNOP-SoloWAN is an enhanced version of the [Open Network Optimization Platform (OpenNOP)](http://www.opennop.org/). It implements a modern dictionary based compression algorithm to add deduplication capabilities to OpenNOP. 

SoloWAN is a project of the [Center for Open Middleware (COM)](http://www.centeropenmiddleware.com/) of [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid](http://www.upm.es) which aims to experiment with open-source based WAN optimization solutions.
